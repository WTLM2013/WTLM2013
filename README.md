### Hi there, I'm Will! 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently trying to learn Lua and Python.
- 💪 I have experience writing in HTML, CSS, Java, and a very small amount of C++.
- 🤖 Former FRC scouting lead, and one of the pilot testers for <a href="https://github.com/FIRSTTeam102/ScoringApp-Serverless">Scoutradioz</a> in 2019.
- 🎮 Favorite Games: I'm an avid fan of the Elite: Dangerous series, and what some may describe as a GMod addict.
- 🚀 I love working alongside the amazing senior management team over at <a href="https://gaminglight.com">Gaminglight</a>!
